We **[launched a new free Deep Reinforcement Learning Course with Hugging Face 🤗](https://huggingface.co/deep-rl-course/unit0/introduction)**


**👉 Register here** http://eepurl.com/h1pElX

**👉 The course**: https://huggingface.co/deep-rl-course/unit0/introduction

📚 The syllabus: https://simoninithomas.github.io/deep-rl-course/

In this updated free course, you will:

- 📖 **Study Deep Reinforcement Learning** in theory and practice.
- 🧑‍💻 Learn to **use famous Deep RL libraries** such as Stable Baselines3, RL Baselines3 Zoo, Sample Factory and CleanRL.
- 🤖 **Train agents in unique environments** such as SnowballFight, Huggy the Doggo 🐶, MineRL (Minecraft ⛏️), VizDoom (Doom) and classical ones such as Space Invaders and PyBullet.
- 💾 **Publish your trained agents in one line of code to the Hub**. But also download powerful agents from the community.
- 🏆 **Participate in challenges** where you will evaluate your agents against other teams. But also play against AI you'll train.
And more!
